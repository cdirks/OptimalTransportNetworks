//! @brief Example for rudimentary implementation of adaptive grids
//!
//! This example contains an example of how the current rudimentary implementation of
//! adaptive grids works (the full finest grid and data structures for it are used, but 
//! only a subset of the DOF is actually used, basis functions have bigger support than
//! in the non-adaptive case). 
//! The code is based on an old implementation by Preusser.
