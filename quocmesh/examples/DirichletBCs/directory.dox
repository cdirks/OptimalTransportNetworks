//! @brief Implementation of Dirichlet and periodic boundary conditions
//!
//! This example contains different methods how Dirichlet boundary conditions
//! can be imposed (full assembling and modification of matrix, masked assembling).
//! Moreover, an example for periodic boundary conditions using the PeriodicityHandler
//! is given.
