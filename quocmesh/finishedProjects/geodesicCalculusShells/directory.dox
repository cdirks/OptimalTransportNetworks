//! @brief Several tools to compute discrete geodesic operators on the space of thin shells.
//!
//! (1) Geodesics / interpolation: Compute geodesic (i.e. shortest path) between
//!     two given input shells represented as triangular meshes.
//!     Call "computeGeodesic.cpp" together with a parameter file, e.g. parComputeGeodesic.txt
//!
//! (2) Exponential map / geodesic shooting / extrapolation: Compute geodesic path for a given input shell
//!     and another shell which is a variation of the first one, hence representing an initial velocity.
//!     Call "shootGeodesic.cpp" together with a parameter file, e.g. parShootGeodesic.txt
//!
//! (3) Parallel transport / detail transfer: Discrete parallel transport realized by construction
//!     of geodesic parallelograms (Schild's ladder) to transport for a given sequence of shells 
//!     a variation/displacement of the first shell to the last one.
//!     Call "computeParallelTransport.cpp" together with a parameter file, e.g. parComputeParallelTransport.txt
//!
//! (4) Elastic / geodesic averaging: For a set of input shapes compute a geodesic average and connecting geodesics,
//!     s.t. the total sum of path energies is minimized.
//!     If the number of shells in the connecting discrete geodesics is set to zero, an elastic average is computed,
//!     i.e. a minimzer of the sum of deformation energies from the input shapes to an (elastic) averaging shell.
//!
